1. Add the play CDN script tag to the 'top' of your HTML record.

     
    
     
    
     
    
         <script src="https://cdn.Tailwind CSScss.com"</script
    

2. Have a go at Customizing your config Edit the 'Tailwind CSS. config' object to redo your setup with your plan tokens.

     
    
     
    
     
    
         <script
          Tailwind CSS.config = {
            topic: {
              expand: {
                colors: {
                  Clifford: '#da373d',
                }
              }
            }
          }
         </script
    

3. All have a go at adding some custom CSS Use 'type=" text/Tailwind CSScss"' to add custom CSS that upholds Tailwind's CSS highlights.

     
    
     
    
     
    
         <style type="text/Tailwind CSScss"
           @layer utilities {
             .content-auto {
               content-permeability: auto;
             }
           }
         </style
         <body
         <div class="lg:content-auto"
           <!-- ... --
         </div
         </body

         <!doctype html
         <html

          <!-- ... --
         </div
         </body
         </html

ðŸŽ¯ Utility-First Fundamentals
=============================

 

 

 

     <div class="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white adjusted xl shadow-lg flex things focus space-x-4"
       <div class="shrink-0"
         <img class="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo"
       </div
       <div
         <div class="text-xl text style medium text-black"ChitChat</div
         <p class="text-record 500"You have a new message!</p
       </div
     </div


 In this model, we have utilized

 *   Tailwind's **flexbox** and **padding** utilities ('flex', 'recoil 0', and 'p-6') to control the general card format
 *   The **max-width** and **margin** utilities ('max-w-sm' and 'MX-auto') to evenly oblige the card width and focus it
 *   The **background color**, **border-radius**, and **box-shadow** utilities ('bg-white, 'adjusted xl', and 'shadow-lg') to style the card's appearance
 *   The **width** and **height** utilities ('w-12' and 'h-12') to measure the logo picture
 *   The **space-between** utilities ('space-x-4') to deal with the dividing between the logo and the text
 *   The **font size**, **text color**, and **font-weight** utilities ('text-xl', 'text-dark', 'text style medium', and so on) to style the card text

 with the assistance of this methodology, we can execute a custom part plan without composing a solitary line of custom CSS.

ðŸŽ¯ Dealing with Hover, Focus, and different States
==========================================

 Tailwind incorporates modifiers for basically all that you'll at any point require, including:

 *   **Pseudo-classes**, as ':drift', ':concentrate', ':first-aid, and ':required'
 *   **Pseudo-elements**, as '::in the past, '::later', '::placeholder', and '::choice'
 *   **Media queries**, as 'responsive breakpoints', 'dim mode', and 'favors decreased movement'
 *   **Trait selectors**, as '[dir="RTL"]' and '[open]'

 **drift, center, active**
 ------------------------

 

 

 

     <button class="bg-violet-500 hover:bg-violet-600 active:bg-violet-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-violet-300 ..."
       Save changes
     </button


 **previously and after**
 --------------------

 ### **before**

 

 

 

     <blockquote class="text-2xl text style semibold italic text-focus text-record 900"
       At the point when you look
       <range class="before:block before:absolute previously:- inset-1 preceding:- slant y-3 before:bg-pink-500 relative inline-block"
         <range class="relative text-white"annoyed</span
       </span
       constantly, individuals feel that you're occupied.
     </blockquote


 ### **after**

 

 

 

     <mark class="block"
       <range class="after:content-['*'] after:ml-0.5 after:text-red-500 block text-sm text style medium text-record 700"
         Email
       </span
       <input type="email" name="email" class="mt-1 px-3 py-2 bg-white line shadow-sm line record 300 placeholder-record 400 focus:outline-none focus:border-sky-500 focus:ring-sky-500 block w-full adjusted MD sm:text-sm focus:ring-1" placeholder="you@example.com"/
     </label

ðŸŽ¯ **Portable First**
-------------------

 Of course, Tailwind utilizes a portable first breakpoint framework, like what you may be utilized to in different systems like Bootstrap.

 

 

 

     <!-- This will focus the text on portable, and left adjust it on screens 640px and more extensive - - 
     <div class="text-focus sm:text-left"</div


ðŸŽ¯ **Focusing on a solitary breakpoint**
------------------------------------

 

 

 

     <div class="bg-green-500 md:bg-red-500 lg:bg-green-500"
       <!-- ... --
     </div


ðŸŽ¯ **Redoing breakpoints**
------------------------------

 You can redo your breakpoints in your **Tailwind CSS.config.js** record:

 

 

 

      module.exports = {
        topic: {
          screens: {
            'tablet': '640px',
            // = @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }
            'PC': '1024px',
            // = @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }
            'work area': '1280px',
            // = @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }
          },
         }
       }
